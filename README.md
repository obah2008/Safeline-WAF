# Safeline-WAF

## Overview 
In this project I'll be setting up two virtual machines, One an Ubuntu server which will be hosting DVWA(Damn Vulnerable Web Application), and another Kali linux, our attacker machine. I'll also be configuring a safeline web application firewall to fend off the attacks from the kali linux virtual machine. 

### What is a WAF
A web application firewall is simply a type of firewall which filters malicious HTTP traffic, thereby preventing attacks like SQL injection, cross site scripting or Cross-site request forgery.  
Safeline is a free and open source Web application firewall created by Safepoint.

## Prerequisites
The projects assumes you have both virtual machines running on virtual box and properly configured such that they can communicate with each other.
