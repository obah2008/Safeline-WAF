# Web Application Firewall (WAF) Attack Protection with Safeline

In this subdomain of the project, weâ€™ll be configuring **Safeline WAF** to detect and block a wide range of common web application attacks. Our testbed is the a deliberately vulnerable web app (**DVWA**) behind the WAF, with attacks simulated from a **Kali Linux machine**.

This setup will demonstrate how to:
- Apply and customize WAF security rules
- Simulate attacks such as SQL Injection, XSS, and Command Injection
- Observe and analyze WAF responses in real-time
- Harden DVWA by tuning detection policies
